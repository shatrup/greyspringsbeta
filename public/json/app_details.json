					"Pedagogy of the app is specially designed and engineered to teach kids how to write. After extensive feedback from various teachers and institutions that specialize in the same domain, we have come up with this app. It starts with the very basics and goes to complex forms very gradually. Here, the kid begins by understanding how to draw standing, sleeping and slanting lines. Slowly the kid proceeds to more complex shapes like curves, circles, square, etc. at his/her own pace, all while enjoying the experience facilitated by fun-filled animations and guidelines. Once, the kid has mastered the basics, he/she can move to alphabets, the small case as well as the capital case, numbers and even cursive writing.",
					"The app not only provides English but also Spanish and Hindi letters. The app is packed with lots of audio-visual effects to keep children interested and engaged during the process. Pre-schoolers will quickly and intuitively pick up the shapes, alphabet, and numbers and build memory retention skills while enjoying the interactivity and sound effects associated with each activity."
